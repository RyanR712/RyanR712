Graduate of The State University of New York at Albany, where my BS was in Computer Science/Applied Mathematics and my minor was in Mathematics. Before that I graduated Dutchess Community College. Most of this education was completed by black coffee but my name is on each degree.

I served on SUNY Albany's IEEE Branch and still communicate with the organization regularly as Trustee Councilor. 

My (aspiring) professional software development interests are in small or mid-sized energetic environments with lots of opportunities to learn. I am currently most comfortable in object oriented languages and interpreted programming language design, although I have an odd interest in assembly languages. Right now I can say I've worked in IBM360/370 (z390 emulator) with EBCDIC and some MIPS. I am also a fan of thorough documentation after the fact.

My personal interests are in English literature, developing mathematical maturity and noisy music. With regards to mathematics, I have the most thorough understanding of a few different formal logics and set theory. I'm getting there!

I hope to get security clearance and a thorough understanding of some discipline in theoretical physics later on in my career.
