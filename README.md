Graduate of The State University of New York at Albany, where my BS was in Computer Science/Applied Mathematics and my minor was in Mathematics. Before that I graduated Dutchess Community College. Most of this education was completed by black coffee but my name is on each degree.

I served on SUNY Albany's IEEE Branch and still communicate with the organization regularly as Trustee Councilor. 

My (aspiring) professional software development interests are in small or mid-sized energetic environments with lots of opportunities to learn. I am currently most comfortable in object oriented languages and interpreted programming language design, although I have an odd interest in assembly languages. Right now I can say I've worked in IBM360/370 (z390 emulator) with EBCDIC and some MIPS. I am also a big proponent of thorough documentation after putting together methods/functions/routines/procedures. I wish more people were.

The work I'm most proud of can be found at RAIRLab/Peirce-My-Heart, in the pinned repositories. The subject of the project is decently theoretical, but implementing all that required a lot of applied computer science/software development topics and long days. There were long discussions over naming conventions, lots of questions asked, lots of questions answered from manager-to-peer and peer-to-peer, style guidelines, uniform tools used, GUIs sketched, etcetera. Its period of rapid development (Fall 2023) was one of the most enjoyable times in my life and I still contribute to it on and off for fun.

My personal interests are in English literature, developing mathematical maturity and noisy music. With regards to mathematics, I have the most thorough understanding of a few different formal logics and set theory. I'm getting there!

I hope to get security clearance and a thorough understanding of some discipline in theoretical physics later on in my career.
